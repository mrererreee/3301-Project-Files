# 3301-Project-Files

These are all the lab files from my Intro to Microcontrollers class with Professor Eddin at Cal Poly Pomona.
These programs may not be fully optimized as I was still learning the material at the time, but I 
published them as reference to older concepts as I continue to pursue working with other 
microcontrollers.
